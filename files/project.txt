We plan to develop a chat application on the lines of Snap Chat. Users can send each other not just text but also other media files such as pictures and videos.  Furthermore the media files sent to users get deleted after a certain time - encouraging users to send more data. We allow the user to set time limits for deletion.

The user at the other end is allowed to save the files sent to him/her , in which case the sender is informed about this action. By default, files/texts sent are deleted after some fixed amount of time.

 The messages will be displayed as is displayed as on popular applications, as a stream of text strings. After a certain amount of time, these will get destroyed automatically.

For media files, the timer begins counting down only after the user activates it (by clicking on it). The file is then viewed/played, and deleted after the ordained time.
