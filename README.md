Basic Documentation

The UI is a three tabbed structure.
In the first tab we provide statistics.
Day of the week is another input given to us by the user for this tab.
Second tab we use training data to come up with predictions for the testing data.
We also find anamolies in the data. The anamolies are listed in descending order based on value
User can specify how many he wants to see.
In the third tab we generate trend analysis for the file specified using CUSUM.
Threshhold and drift are parameters user can specify based on the data in the input file.

Format of the data input file should match Oct_Data.csv which can be seen in this folder.
That is the value we want to generate all these graphs on must be in the 8th column of the csv.
